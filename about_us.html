          the key accessory - the bag.<br /><br /><br />In the future, SILFEN is
          working on colorful designs in different kinds of material. They love
          to play with textures and a wide range of materials in order to
          challenge their own perception of creating new styles.<br /><br /><br />Designer
          Daniel Silfen is never afraid of trying new combinations in order to
          continuously develop the brand. The aim with the brand is to offer
